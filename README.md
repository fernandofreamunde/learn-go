# learn-go

I'm using this repo to place dummy experiments with go.

In case someone had fallen here by accident I'm following this website:
https://gobyexample.com

Basically it is just a copy from what is in that site, some notes and references for my self.(not many really xD)


As recommended to carry on after reaching the error section of the previous link, now I'm prceding with go for web apps, you can check it in the link:
https://gowebexamples.com

in this repo I am only adding my following of these tutorials. I do have an Idea of an app to build with go and will do that later on, as soon as I finish this tutorials...
